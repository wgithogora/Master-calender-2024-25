# School Timetable 2024/2025

## Project Overview
This project is a recreation of the 2024/2025 academic year timetable using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It follows the fixed layout as shown in the assignment and includes periods, devotion, breaks, lunch, clubs, games, and teacher allocations.

## Files
- `index.html` – Main HTML file containing the timetable structure.
- `style.css` – External stylesheet for styling the timetable.
- `README.md` – Project description and accessibility considerations.
- `timetable_preview.png` – Screenshot of the timetable.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Table headers use `<th>` with proper scope to improve screen reader compatibility.
- Semantic HTML (`<thead>`, `<tbody>`) ensures logical structure.
- Alt text is included for the timetable preview image.
- High contrast green and-white design for readability.

## Validation
The HTML and CSS files have been tested with:
- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
